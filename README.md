# Extended-depth-of-field-in-Holographic-images
– Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that simultaneously performs autofocusing and phase recovery
to significantly extend the depth-of-field and increase the reconstruction speed in holographic imaging.
– Data set creation- pair of randomly defocused holograms of polystyrene particles or micro planktons and their
corresponding in-focus phase recovered images and training a CNN inspired by U-Net Architecture.
